### TFWP's stamp of approval:
- When you contribute to the TFWP source code, you are making a statement: you would like to help others in their pursuit of becoming better coders personally or professionally. This deserves recognition. This is why TFWP is introducing contributor badges so you can identify yourself to others in your support of TFWP. The hope is people will take your contribution to TFWP seriously. No matter what anyone tells you, being part of the open source community is a volunteer position. In a world of increasing technological reliance, you are making it easier for people to gain value from technology. Pat yourself on the back and please use our contributor badges - one is specifically for Android but the template is there in case we branch out in the future.
