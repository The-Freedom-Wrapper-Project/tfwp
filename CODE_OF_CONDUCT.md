### Code of Conduct:
- The key to a thriving coding community is to welcome new coders. If you are being overly critical, you are not being welcoming. Please take efforts to ensure you are helping to create this type of community. The golden rule is as valid today as it was when I was in elementary school: treat others how you would like to be treated. 

- Be open-minded to criticism but absolutely push back against criticism that is not oriented to doing something better. Practical considerations are the only forms of criticism that actually matter to TFWP. However, when you recieve criticism that could be considered reasonable by any reasonable person, say thank you, take steps to fix those problems, annotating your reasoning, and move on to continue your pursuit. Don't stop making the worldðŸŒŽ a better place because someone is trying to help you.

- All communication, in terms of `git commit -m`, git descriptions, and comments, must be done with empathy that takes our own humanity into account. If you disagree with someone, one response is enough to say your peace. Promote a respectful dialogue and don't make your comments or contributions about proving someone else is wrong. Instead, change the dialogue constructively. Sometimes to do this, you'll just need to agree to disagree. Coders like to think there are coding facts. The truth is: there are a million-and-one ways to code something. Code is like a far more structured opinion. Like code, you have to stick to specific grammatical constraints in any language called syntax. However, language, like code, is virtually never written the same way - even when the content is the exact same and the syntax is set. Coders will disagree stylistically, like art critiques disagree on impressionism vs surrealism.

	- Remember the rule of four. The rule of four is a TFWP special rule. At its core, it finds that coders think of themselves in one role instead of the four roles that characterize their professional capacity. It is the equivalent of a Football Coach and Player who says they are a Football expert. Everyone is left wondering: "Yeah, but what kind of Football expert exactly? A Coach, a Player, a Trainer, a Coordinator, any number of sub-coaches, the team doctor? You have told me literally nothing." Four was a mostly arbitrary selection but we liked it so we used it - don't read too far into it. The principle stands: your perspective matters and so does everyone elses; whether someone implements your solution is totally based on how you present it. **Please present your solutions with respect, otherwise no one will think you are making a serious suggestion, improvement, or criticism, rendering your contribution ineffective and therefore moot.**

- At TFWP, we believe in locking conversations when we feel they are complete. We also believe in reporting indecent comments to GitHub based on their [policies](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/site-policy/github-community-guidelines#what-is-not-allowed). Although, if it becomes a common occurrence, we will start to think someone is out to get us with controversy culture - which is a shame because we are trying to making the worldðŸŒŽ a better place.
	
	- Keep in mind, GitHub may take action against you if your contributions or comments violate their policies in the form of:
		1. Content Removal
		2. Content Blocking
		3. Account Suspension
		4. Account Termination
		
- The license for this Code of Conduct can be found [here](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). Since a number of elements in this Code of Conduct were distilled from GitHub's policies, we subsumed our own Code of Conduct under their licensing framework. Feel free to use it for your own repository.

##### A comment, contribution, or other related activity oriented towards TFWP must adhere to this Code of Conduct. Sometimes we all lose our cool and TFWP will not always permanently ban people in situations where contributors or comments create hostile environments. That said, we reserve the right to enforce **[GitHub policies](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/site-policy/github-community-guidelines)** at our level in order to create a coding community we can all be proud of in real-time.
